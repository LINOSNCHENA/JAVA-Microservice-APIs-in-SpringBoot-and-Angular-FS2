# TWO PARTS MICROSERVICES AS BACKEND & FRONTEND APIs

The purpose of this application is to create a full-stack simple application by combining two of the current popular frameworks. Angular, Spring-Boot and three different databases. The implementation works with three types of databases.Several CRUD operations are implemented and exploited using three different databases

### Technology Stack exploited

The development full-stack application composes of;
1. JavaScript(Angular 8)
2. Java 8-13 (Spring boot)
3. Database(MSSQL,Postgresql,MySQL)
4. Pending Database(MongoDB, H2)
5. Maven
6. Catalina Run
7. Hibernate
8. Tomcat Server

Note: The database key-field in MySQL and MSSQL is auto-increment while in the Postgressql database the key-field used is serial instead of auto-increment. Need changes in the data model where necessary. 

### Execution Commands

Two separate modules make up this application
1. Backend module use the following Command
        mvn clean package
        mvn spring boot run
2. Front End application use the following command
        npm start
        npm stop
